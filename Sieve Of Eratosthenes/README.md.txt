This C program is used to implement Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate prime numbers between given range. The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple algorithm that finds the prime numbers up to a given integer. Implement this algorithm, with the only allowed optimization that the outer loop can stop at the square root of the limit, and the inner loop may start at the square of the prime just found. That means especially that you shouldn’t optimize by using pre-computed wheels
